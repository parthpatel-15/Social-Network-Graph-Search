# Social-Network-Graph-Search

This Python program showcases the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find connections between individuals in a social network graph. It uses a custom-defined graph with relationships between people. The code consists of the following components:

Node class: Represents a node in the search tree, used to construct the BFS tree. The tree helps visualize the exploration process.

State class: Retrieves state information for social connections, such as the name of the person, the goal to achieve, and the graph of relationships.

BFS_Parth(graph, initname, goal) function: Performs BFS search using a queue. It explores the graph to find connections between individuals and determine whether a specific connection (goal) exists. The function also checks for various error conditions and handles them gracefully.


#Note:
The code demonstrates BFS with a provided social network graph and custom test cases.
The program visually displays the BFS tree and the path from the initial name to the target name.
Feel free to use or modify this code to explore social network connections within your own graph.
